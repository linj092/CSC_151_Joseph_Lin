These algorithms, often based on machine learning techniques like neural networks, learn to recognize relationships within the data and then apply that knowledge to new, unseen data to solve problems or perform tasks autonomously. Essentially, AI aims to mimic human intelligence by learning from experience and improving over time.\n"
